## Flutter clean-architecture
a clean architecture project
## Flutter Clean Architecture with Firebase
This project demonstrates the use of advanced topics such as Clean Architecture,
Firebase integration, Bloc pattern for state management, and Hive for local storage.
# The application 
follows the principles of Clean Architecture and is structured into three primary layers:

## Data Layer: 
This layer includes the models, data sources (remote and local), and the repositories. It interacts with Firebase for remote data and Hive for local data.

## Domain Layer: 
This layer contains the core business logic (use cases) and entity definitions.

## Presentation Layer:
This is where the UI-related logic resides. It uses Bloc for state management.
